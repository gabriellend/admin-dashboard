# admin-dashboard

Done for my DevIsland students from the Odin Project. The assignment was to create something like [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) using Grid. I decided to try to copy it as closely as possible since most dev positions work with designers who have specific visions that you need to match.
